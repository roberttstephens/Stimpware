Project notes: 

Whole project:
 - Ordinarilly while doing a project, I freely use code (copyright permitting of course) to write as efficiently as possible. Since this is a project showing that I am capable, I haven't used any outside libraries (except for jquery).   

 - I've debated familiarizing myself with an IDE more, but have decided that vim offers all of the capabilities that I need, and some research shows that quite a few professionals use vim. I have it set up for tab completion, autoindention, tabs, and tag wrappers. I'm definitely willing to learn an IDE, but man I love vim. I had a great time tweaking it for php and html. 

 - Once done, I really want to get into some more python, then work my way to lower level. I'm dying to mess with some java projects. (this has nothing to do with work, just a personal note). 


Database: 
 - I'm no longer doing quotes for the database. it doesn't give me the ability to optimize the database, and doing "group by" the author doesn't make much sense anyway. I've decided to do something a little more applicable to the real world. Cont...

 - It's an optimized relational database for mysql using the InnoDB engine. The default engine didn't allow foreign keys (which I find quite necessary to ensure there is no data corruption). For good practice, I have entered all of the mysql in the cli instead of a gui such as phpmyadmin. I'm actually quite surprised that the default mysql engine doesn't allow foreign keys. Even microsoft access does :-P. I also went through the settings (caching, concurrent users and such) to make sure that I will get optimum performance.  

 - The database code that was entered is at the way bottom. 

Git/github:
 - Awesome, I've heard how it's better than subversion, but this is the first that I've used it. It's a really cool implementation. I like the community behind git also. 

Javascript/jquery:
 - Originally I was using jquery to toggle divs if an anchor tag was clicked. It ended up being easier to write a basic onclick javascript function. The site needs to be accessible via phones, but I've put stuff like that on hold until I actually finish the project (I took too much time messing with trivial things). Jquery is still being used to load elements into a div.

CSS:
 - I kind of confused myself working with too many nested elements. It works, but it should have been written cleaner. Some children elements have attributes that are already defined by their parents which makes it more difficult to read than necessary. Like above, I may mess with it once I get the core site functionality.


Php: 
  - I've somewhat familiarized myself with php5, since I was writing with php4. php5 can be quite different and is more similar to java. I'm still not completely used to the syntax, but it's a work in progress. Php5 also uses mysqli (which supports mysql 5.1) which can be used quite differently (as with php5, treating things as classes and objects). Not particurally related, but I was beginning to dislike php. Php5 actually makes me kind of like it again. It has nice structures. I also like the mysqli, which is faster than mysql of php4. 

It's 3 am, and I'm probably ranting, so I'll do more later on.
